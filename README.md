#  Discord Bot with ChatGPT integration

This Discord bot is integrated with ChatGPT using the OpenAI API.

If you are stuck with anything, feel free to shoot me a message on discord at `.faro`

# Usage
To use this, you need Python 3.11+ and all of the required packages installed.
To install the required packages, run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

When you have it up and running, it will ONLY respond to pings on Discord.

## Client ID
You will need to populate ```/src/.env``` with an OpenAI API key and a Discord Token.
If you are unsure of how to generate/find these, give it a quick Google search.
